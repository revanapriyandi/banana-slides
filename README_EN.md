## ✨ Project Origin

Have you ever found yourself in this predicament: your presentation is due tomorrow, but the slides are still blank; your head is full of brilliant ideas, yet your enthusiasm is drained by tedious layout and design?

We all aspire to quickly create professional and well-designed presentations. While traditional AI PPT generation apps generally meet the need for "speed," they still face the following issues:

- 1️⃣ Limited to preset templates, with no flexibility to adjust styles.
- 2️⃣ Low freedom, making multi-round revisions difficult.
- 3️⃣ Highly similar outcomes with severe homogenization.
- 4️⃣ Low-quality assets that lack relevance.
- 5️⃣ Disjointed text and image layouts with poor design sense.

These shortcomings prevent traditional AI PPT generators from simultaneously meeting our two major requirements: "speed" and "aesthetics." Even those claiming to be "Vibe PPT" are, in my view, far from being truly "Vibe."

However, the emergence of the nano banana🍌 model has changed everything. I tried using 🍌pro to generate PPT slides and found the results to be exceptional in quality, aesthetics, and consistency. It accurately renders almost all text required by the prompts and faithfully follows the style of reference images. So, why not build a native "Vibe PPT" application based on 🍌pro?

## 👨‍💻 Applicable Scenarios

1. **Beginners**: Generate beautiful PPTs quickly with zero entry barrier and no design experience required, reducing the hassle of choosing templates.
2. **PPT Professionals**: Reference AI-generated layouts and combinations of graphics and text to spark design inspiration quickly.
3. **Educators**: Quickly convert teaching content into illustrated PPT lesson plans to enhance classroom effectiveness.
4. **Students**: Complete presentation assignments fast, allowing them to focus on content rather than layout and aesthetics.
5. **Professionals**: Rapidly visualize business proposals and product introductions with quick adaptation to various scenarios.

## **🔧 Frequently Asked Questions**

1. **Garbled text or blurry text on generated pages**
    - You can choose a higher output resolution (the OpenAI format may not support increasing resolution; the Gemini format is recommended). According to tests, adjusting the resolution from 1k to 2k before generating the page significantly improves text rendering quality.
    - Please ensure that the page description includes the specific text content you want to render.

2. **Poor results when exporting editable PPTs, such as overlapping text or missing styles**
    - In 90% of cases, this is due to an API configuration issue. Please refer to the troubleshooting and solutions in [issue 121](https://github.com/Anionex/banana-slides/issues/121).

3. **Is the free tier Gemini API Key supported?**
    - The free tier only supports text generation and does not support image generation.

4. **503 Error or Retry Error when generating content**
    - You can check the Docker backend logs using the commands provided in the README to locate the detailed error for the 503 issue. This is generally caused by incorrect model configuration.

5. **Why is the API Key set in .env not taking effect?**
    - After editing the `.env` file during runtime, you must restart the Docker container to apply the changes.
    - If you have previously configured parameters on the web settings page, they will override the parameters in the `.env` file. You can revert to the `.env` settings by clicking "Restore Default Settings."

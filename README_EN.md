## ✨ Project Origin

Have you ever found yourself in this dilemma: the report is due tomorrow, but the PPT is still a blank slate; you have countless brilliant ideas in your head, yet all your passion is drained by tedious formatting and design?

We long to quickly create presentations that are both professional and well-designed. While traditional AI PPT generation apps generally meet the demand for "speed," several issues persist:

- 1️⃣ Only pre-set templates can be selected, with no flexibility to adjust styles.
- 2️⃣ Low degree of freedom, making it difficult to perform multi-round revisions.
- 3️⃣ The final results look remarkably similar, suffering from severe homogeneity.
- 4️⃣ The quality of materials is low and lacks relevance.
- 5️⃣ The layout of images and text is disjointed, with poor design aesthetics.

These flaws make it difficult for traditional AI PPT generators to simultaneously satisfy our two core needs for PPT production: "speed" and "beauty." Even those claiming to be "Vibe PPT" are, in my eyes, still far from having enough "Vibe."

However, the emergence of the nano banana🍌 model has changed everything. I tried using 🍌pro for PPT page generation and found that the results were exceptional in terms of quality, aesthetics, and consistency. Moreover, it can accurately render almost all text requested in the prompts and faithfully follow the style of reference images. Why not build a native "Vibe PPT" application based on 🍌pro?

## 👨‍💻 Use Cases

1. **Beginners**: Rapidly generate beautiful PPTs with zero barriers and no design experience required, eliminating the trouble of template selection.
2. **PPT Professionals**: Quickly gain design inspiration by referencing AI-generated layouts and visual-text combinations.
3. **Educators**: Swiftly convert teaching content into illustrated lesson plans to improve classroom outcomes.
4. **Students**: Complete presentation assignments quickly, focusing energy on content rather than formatting and aesthetics.
5. **Professionals**: Quickly visualize business proposals and product introductions with rapid adaptation across various scenarios.

## 🎯 Features

### 1. Flexible and Diverse Creative Paths

Supports three starting modes: **Idea**, **Outline**, and **Page Description**, catering to different creative habits.
- **One-sentence Generation**: Enter a topic, and the AI automatically generates a well-structured outline and page-by-page content descriptions.
- **Natural Language Editing**: Supports modifying the outline or descriptions via natural language using Vibe (e.g., "Change page three to a case study"), with the AI responding and adjusting in real-time.
- **Outline/Description Mode**: Supports both one-click batch generation and manual adjustment of details.

### 2. Powerful Asset Parsing Capability

- **Multi-format Support**: Upload PDF, Docx, MD, Txt, and other files for automatic background content parsing.
- **Intelligent Extraction**: Automatically identifies key points, image links, and chart information within the text to provide rich materials for generation.
- **Style Reference**: Supports uploading reference images or templates to customize the PPT style.

### 3. "Vibe"-style Natural Language Modification

No longer limited by complex menu buttons, issue modification commands directly through **natural language**.
- **Local Inpainting**: Perform verbal-style modifications on unsatisfactory areas (e.g., "Change this chart to a pie chart").
- **Full-page Optimization**: Generate high-definition, style-consistent pages based on nano banana pro🍌.

### 4. Out-of-the-box Format Export

- **Multi-format Support**: One-click export to standard **PPTX** or **PDF** files.
- **Perfect Fit**: Default 16:9 aspect ratio, no manual layout adjustment needed, ready for immediate presentation.

# 🚀 Quick Start

This guide will help you set up and run the **GPT-Web-Java** project locally.

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure your development environment has the following tools installed:

*   **Java 17+** (OpenJDK 17 recommended)
*   **Node.js 18+** & **pnpm** (for frontend builds)
*   **MySQL 8.0+**
*   **Redis** (for caching and rate limiting)
*   **OpenAI API Key** or a compatible proxy address

## 🛠️ Backend Configuration

### 1. Clone Project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/gpt-web-java.git
cd gpt-web-java
```

### 2. Database Initialization

1. Create a database named `gpt_web`.
2. Execute the script in `sql/init.sql` to create the necessary table structures and initial data.

### 3. Modify Configuration Files

In the `backend/src/main/resources` directory, locate `application-dev.yml` and modify the following configurations:

```yaml
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/gpt_web?useSSL=false&allowPublicKeyRetrieval=true
    username: root
    password: your_password
  data:
    redis:
      host: localhost
      port: 6379

openai:
  api-key: sk-xxxx...
  base-url: https://api.openai.com/ # Modify here if using a proxy
```

## 💻 Frontend Configuration

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd frontend
pnpm install
```

### 2. Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory:

```env
VITE_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

## 🏃 Running the Project

### Start Backend

Use an IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA) to run `GptWebApplication.java`.

### Start Frontend

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Now, you can access `http://localhost:3000` via your browser to start your experience!

#### Frontend Installation

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory**
```bash
cd frontend
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Configure API address**

The frontend will automatically connect to the backend service at `http://localhost:5000`. If you need to modify it, please edit `src/api/client.ts`.

#### Start Backend Service

> (Optional) If you have important data locally, it is recommended to back up the database before upgrading:  
> `cp backend/instance/database.db backend/instance/database.db.bak`

```bash
cd backend
uv run alembic upgrade head && uv run python app.py
```

The backend service will start at `http://localhost:5000`.

Access `http://localhost:5000/health` to verify if the service is running correctly.

#### Start Frontend Development Server

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

The frontend development server will start at `http://localhost:3000`.

Open your browser to access the application.

**FAQ**
1.  **Is the free tier Gemini API Key supported?**
    *   The free tier only supports text generation; image generation is not supported.
2.  **Encountering 503 error or Retry Error during content generation**
    *   You can check the internal Docker logs using the command provided in the README to locate the detailed error for the 503 issue. This is usually caused by incorrect model configuration.
3.  **Why is the API Key not working after setting it in .env?**
    1.  Editing `.env` at runtime requires restarting the Docker container to apply changes.
    2.  If settings were configured via the web settings page, they will override the parameters in `.env`. You can revert to `.env` settings via "Restore Default Settings."
4.  **Garbled characters appearing in the generated page text**
    *   Try using a higher resolution output (the OpenAI format may not support increasing resolution).
    *   Ensure that the specific text content to be rendered is included in the page description.
